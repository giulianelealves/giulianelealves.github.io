# The better voice to write technical content

While you search to learn more about voices in technical content, you've found two voices: active and passive voices. These two voices are grammatically correct, but what voice is the better choice to write technical content?

Let's learn more about these two voices to understand their structure and why one is better than another one.

## Active voice

In my experience as a technical writer and my researchers, there is just one prevalent phrase, "Keep the voice more active whenever you can."

In the active voice, an actor performs an action. The grammatical subject of the sentence is the person or thing that performs the action. 

**Example**  

`The software requires the .Net Framework to run.` 

In this sentence, you have:

The actor: **The software**  
The verb: **requires**  
The target: **the .Net Framework to run**  

## Passive voice

In the passive voice, a target is achieved by the actor. The grammatical subject of the sentence is the person or thing being acted upon.

The use of passive voice is not recommended. Here are some motives to avoid passive voice:

- Often use more words than active voice
- Can be vague
- Can lead to a tangle of prepositional phrases
- Is easy to neglect the actor of the sentence
- It's hard for readers to figure out who's supposed to do something

**Example**  

`The .Net Framework is required to run the software.`

In this sentence, you have:

The target: **The .Net Framework**  
The verb (past participle): **is required**  
The actor: **to run the software**  

You also can have a scenario where using the passive voice you can't know who are the actor. Who performs the action. See the example below:

`The Application Programming Interface (API) needs to be updated.`

In this sentence, the actor is omitted. You aren't right about how to perform the action to update the API. You might suppose that can be the reader, the computer, the server, or an end-user.

Besides that, there are sentences where you can use passive voice. The table below shows the scenarios and their examples:

|Scenario|Example|
|---|---|
|To emphasize an object over an action.|The file is saved.|
|To de-emphasize a subject or actor.|Over 50 conflicts were found in the file.ยน|
|If your readers don't need to know who's responsible for the action.|The database was purged in January.|
|To emphasize the action rather than the actor|After a long debate, the proposal was endorsed by the long-range planning committee.|
|To keep the subject and focus consistent throughout a passage|The data processing department recently presented what proved to be a controversial proposal to expand its staff. After a long debate, the proposal was endorsed by...|
|To be tactful by not naming the actor|The procedures were somehow misinterpreted.|
|To describe a condition in which the actor is unknown or unimportant|Every year, thousands of people are diagnosed as having cancer.|
|To create an authoritative tone|Visitors are not allowed after 9:00 p.m.|
|Avoiding condescending text or blaming the customer, especially in errors, warnings, or notifications||
|Avoiding awkward constructions||
|Emphasizing the receiver of the action||

ยน Using the active voice in the same example, you might have, "You created over 50 conflicts in the file." It is not recommended because you are saying the user make the mistake.
